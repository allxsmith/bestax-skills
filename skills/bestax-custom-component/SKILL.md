# Building a custom component the bestax way

This skill teaches how to build a component that isn't in the library — composed from bestax
pieces in an app, or as a full library "extra" inside the bestax monorepo.

## Which context are you in?

- **The bestax monorepo** (the repo contains `bulma-ui/src/`) → follow
  `references/library-contributor.md` instead of this file: five-file layout, SCSS partial,
  stories, jest tests, docs page, wiring.
- **An app depending on `@allxsmith/bestax-bulma`** (e.g. scaffolded by `npm create bestax`) →
  continue here. Everything below assumes public package imports and a plain Vite app.

For **form** components (Field/Control/Input/etc.) use the `bestax-form` skill instead.

## Check for an existing component first

Before building anything, **search the library for a component that already does this — or a
close synonym** — and tell the user what you found. Many requests are covered by an existing
element, or are best built by composing existing ones. Building a near-duplicate (a "label" when
`Tag` exists, a "banner" when `Notification` exists) fragments the API and is usually the wrong
call.

Where to look:

- `references/component-catalog.md` — **start here.** Every documented component with a one-line
  purpose, grouped by category. Scan it for the name and its synonyms before anything else.
- https://bestax.io/docs/api — one doc page per shipped component (full props).

Then decide, and **surface the decision to the user**:

- **Exact / synonym match exists** → recommend using it. Don't build a duplicate. (E.g. a small
  colored label/badge/chip → `Tag` / `Tags` already exist.)
- **Partial overlap** → prefer **composing** the existing pieces inside your new component
  rather than re-implementing them. (E.g. a "profile card" → there's no `ProfileCard`, but
  `Card`, `Image`, `Title`, `SubTitle`, and `Content` exist; build `ProfileCard` to compose them.)
- **Genuine gap** → build the new component using the pattern below.

State plainly which case applies before writing code, e.g. _"`Tag` already covers a colored
label — use that instead"_ or _"No `ProfileCard` exists; I'll build one composing the existing
`Card`/`Image`/`Title` elements."_

## Composition first

Build from existing components before writing any CSS: `Box`, `Card`, `Title`, `SubTitle`,
`Icon`, `Block`, `Content`, `Tag`, plus the shared Bulma helper props (spacing, color,
typography, flexbox). Some compound sub-parts are the exception — `Modal.Card`, `Tabs.Tab`,
`Message.Body` take **no Bulma helper props**, just `className` + HTML attributes
plus their own few (`Tabs.Tab` requires `index={i}` and has built-in `disabled` and
`icon`/`iconLibrary`/`iconVariant`/`iconSize`/`iconFeatures` — don't nest an `<Icon>` there) —
so put helper props on the parent or on an element inside them, never invent them there.
(`Card.*` sub-parts do take helper props, like `Table.*`/`Menu.*`/`Hero.*`.) Most "custom components" are a composition function — zero new styles.
See `examples/stat-card.tsx` for a complete worked example.

Rendering something only the browser knows (the reader's time zone, a `localStorage` value)?
Wrap it in the library's `ClientOnly` rather than checking `typeof window`: it renders a fallback
until the page has hydrated, so the server and client markup match. `references/api.md` has the
details.

A panel opened from a button (a filter form, share options, an inline edit) is `Popover`: use
it rather than building one. It anchors the panel, moves focus in and back, and closes on
Escape and outside presses.

Building something else that floats (a command palette)? Render it through the library's
`Portal` rather than `createPortal`: it renders nothing on the server and during hydration, so
the server and client markup match. `references/api.md` has the details.

Building some other overlay that holds focus until it is dismissed (a command palette)? Use the
library's `useFocusTrap` rather than a hand-rolled Tab handler: it finds the tab stops the
browser visits and hands focus back on close. `references/api.md` has the signature and a worked
panel.

## The component spine

Same shape the library itself uses, with all imports from the package. Every reusable
component gets it — including pure compositions with zero CSS (a heading block, a labeled
wrapper): extend `BulmaClassesProps`, run your props through `useBulmaClasses`, merge its
`bulmaHelperClasses` into `className`, and spread the `rest` **it** returns — spreading the raw
props instead leaks helper props onto the DOM and emits none of their classes. The
`usePrefixedClassNames` root class is needed only when component-scoped CSS (or a variant
class) targets it — a zero-CSS composition may omit that call. File at
`src/components/MyComponent.tsx`:

```tsx
import type React from 'react';
import {
  classNames,
  usePrefixedClassNames,
  useBulmaClasses,
  type BulmaClassesProps,
} from '@allxsmith/bestax-bulma';

export interface MyComponentProps
  extends
    Omit<React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLDivElement>, 'color'>,
    Omit<BulmaClassesProps, 'color'> {
  color?: 'primary' | 'link' | 'info' | 'success' | 'warning' | 'danger';
}

export function MyComponent({
  color,
  className,
  children,
  ...props
}: MyComponentProps) {
  const { bulmaHelperClasses, rest } = useBulmaClasses(props);
  const mainClasses = usePrefixedClassNames('mycomponent', {
    [`is-${color}`]: !!color,
  });
  return (
    <div
      className={classNames(mainClasses, bulmaHelperClasses, className)}
      {...rest}
    >
      {children}
    </div>
  );
}
```

This gives your component the full Bulma helper-prop surface (`m`, `p`, `textAlign`, …) for
free. `references/api.md` documents the helpers.

## Styling ladder — use the lowest rung that works

**Rung 1 — helper props only (default).** House rules: never `style={{}}`. Layout with
`Block`/`Box` and `display="flex"`, `flexDirection`, `alignItems`, `justifyContent`, and space
the children with `gap`. Before writing `style={{ … }}` anywhere, translate each declaration:

| Inline style you're about to write       | Helper props instead                                                                                                                                           |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `marginTop: '1rem'` (any margin/padding) | `mt="4"` — `m`/`mt`/`mx`/`p`/`py`/… scale: `1`=0.25rem, `2`=0.5rem, `3`=0.75rem, `4`=1rem, `5`=1.5rem, `6`=3rem (nearest step)                                 |
| `textAlign: 'center'`                    | `textAlign="centered"` (also `left`, `right`, `justified`)                                                                                                     |
| `color: '#…'`                            | `textColor` with the nearest Bulma color: `primary`, `link`, `info`, `success`, `warning`, `danger`, `white`, `black`, `grey` (+ `grey-light`, `grey-dark`, …) |
| `backgroundColor: '#…'`                  | `bgColor` (same palette)                                                                                                                                       |
| `fontSize: …`                            | `textSize="1"`…`"7"` (`1` largest) — for headings use `Title`/`SubTitle` `size`                                                                                |
| `fontWeight: …`                          | `textWeight`: `light`, `normal`, `medium`, `semibold`, `bold`                                                                                                  |
| `textTransform`, italics                 | `textTransform`: `uppercase`, `lowercase`, `capitalized`, `italic`                                                                                             |
| `display: 'flex'` + flex properties      | same-named props: `display="flex"`, `flexDirection`, `justifyContent`, `alignItems`, `flexWrap`                                                                |
| `height: '100%'` on a flex child         | `flexGrow="1"`                                                                                                                                                 |
| `display: 'none'`                        | `visibility="hidden"`, or responsive `display*` props (`displayMobile`, `displayTablet`, …)                                                                    |
| `gap: '1rem'` (flex or grid)             | `gap="2"`, or one axis: `columnGap`, `rowGap`; gap scale: `1`=0.5rem, `2`=1rem, `4`=2rem, half steps (`"1.5"`)                                                 |

Spacing, typography, and flex helpers are on every component; `textColor`/`bgColor` are on
the content components you'll compose with (`Box`, `Block`, `Title`, `Content`, `Card`, …) —
the ones with a semantic `color` variant (`Tag`, `Tabs`, `Panel`) take `color` instead.
`Notification` is the mixed case: it takes `textColor`, but its background comes from the
semantic `color` prop, not `bgColor`.

A value with no helper equivalent (`maxWidth: 720`, a one-off gradient) moves you to rung 2 —
a named class in a stylesheet — never to inline `style`.

**Rung 2 — a plain CSS file**, scoped under the component's class, consuming `--bulma-*`
variables — never literal colors, so `Theme` and dark mode keep working:

```css
/* src/components/MyComponent.css — import from the .tsx file */
.mycomponent {
  /* component-scoped custom props, initialized from Bulma tokens:
     any ancestor (or Theme) can re-theme by overriding them */
  --mycomponent-radius: var(--bulma-radius);
  --mycomponent-accent: var(--bulma-primary);
  border-radius: var(--mycomponent-radius);
  border: 1px solid var(--bulma-border);
  background: var(--bulma-scheme-main);
  color: var(--bulma-text);
}
.mycomponent .mycomponent-value {
  color: var(--mycomponent-accent);
}
```

Caveat: with the prefixed CSS flavor / `ConfigProvider classPrefix`, `usePrefixedClassNames`
prefixes your classes too — your CSS selectors must match (or build them with plain
`classNames` instead).

**Rung 3 — real Sass (optional).** `npm i -D sass` — nothing else; Vite compiles imported
`.scss` zero-config, and `bulma` is resolvable because it's a runtime dependency of
bestax-bulma. Then the full `register-vars`/`getVar` pattern from
`references/library-contributor.md` works in-app. Prefixed flavor:
`@use 'bulma/sass/utilities/initial-variables' with ($class-prefix: 'bestax-')`.

## Verify in the browser

Types don't see layout. Run `npm run dev`, render the component, and actually look at it:
vertical centering of inline text (use `display="flex" alignItems="center"`, not line-height
hacks), balanced padding, nothing clipping, every color/size variant, and **dark mode**
legibility. Fix what you see, then re-check. No browser available (headless)? Fall back to
`npm run build` plus a Node `renderToString` smoke render, grep the emitted HTML for the
expected classes, and flag the visual pass as not done.

## Tests and stories in an app

The scaffolded app has **no test runner and no Storybook** — do not install or scaffold them
unasked. If the app already has vitest/jest + Testing Library, write the four test shapes:
render, prop→class mapping, helper-prop passthrough (`m="3"` → `m-3`), and the
`ConfigProvider classPrefix` case if the app uses a prefix.

## Checklist

- [ ] Inventory checked (catalog + bestax.io/docs/api) and the decision surfaced to the user.
- [ ] All imports from `@allxsmith/bestax-bulma` (no deep/internal paths).
- [ ] Composition first — existing components + helper props before any CSS; every reusable component gets the spine.
- [ ] No inline `style={{}}` anywhere — translate via the rung-1 mapping table; values with
      no helper equivalent get a named class (rung 2).
- [ ] Lowest sufficient ladder rung (helper props → scoped CSS vars → Sass).
- [ ] All colors/radii derived from `--bulma-*` variables — no literals.
- [ ] Renders correctly via `npm run dev`, including dark mode.
