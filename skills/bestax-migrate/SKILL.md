description: Migrate an existing React app to @allxsmith/bestax-bulma on Bulma v1, from raw Bulma CSS classes on plain JSX (className="button is-primary") or from an unmaintained React Bulma library (react-bulma-components v4, rbx v2, bloomer 0.6). Run the bestax-migrate codemod, then resolve every TODO(bestax-migrate) comment it leaves using the per-source mapping references. Use when a React app styles its markup with Bulma classes and wants bestax components instead, when a repo imports react-bulma-components, rbx or bloomer, when TODO(bestax-migrate) comments are present in a codebase, or when asked to convert Bulma classNames to bestax-bulma.

# Migrating to bestax-bulma

`@allxsmith/bestax-bulma` is an actively maintained React library for **Bulma v1**. The
`bestax-migrate` codemod automates most of the conversion from an unmaintained predecessor;
this skill drives the codemod and finishes what it flags.

## Pick the source

The codemod's first argument names the library you are migrating _from_. Check the app's
`package.json` and imports:

| Source                                                                           | Argument                 | References                                                                                 |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `react-bulma-components` v4 (unmaintained since 2022, Bulma 0.9.x)               | `react-bulma-components` | [`references/react-bulma-components/`](references/react-bulma-components/component-map.md) |
| `rbx` v2 (abandoned 2019, pins Bulma **0.7.5** plus four extensions)             | `rbx`                    | [`references/rbx/`](references/rbx/component-map.md)                                       |
| `bloomer` 0.6 (archived 2018, Bulma 0.6 era, React 16 + `create-react-class`)    | `bloomer`                | [`references/bloomer/`](references/bloomer/component-map.md)                               |
| Raw Bulma classes on plain JSX (`<div className="box">`), no React Bulma library | `bulma-classes`          | [`references/bulma-classes/`](references/bulma-classes/component-map.md)                   |

Everything below is written as `<source>`; substitute the argument from that table. The
reference paths follow the same split — `references/<source>/component-map.md`,
`prop-map.md`, `unmappables.md` — while
[`references/css-migration.md`](references/css-migration.md) is shared, because the stylesheet
work is about Bulma, not about which wrapper you came from.

## Workflow

Run these steps in order. Don't hand-convert what the codemod converts automatically.

1. **Dry-run the codemod** on the source directory and review the report:

   ```sh
   pnpm dlx bestax-migrate <source> src/ --dry
   ```

2. **Apply it** (same command without `--dry`), then run the project's formatter — the
   codemod preserves surrounding formatting but doesn't prettify what it rewrites.
   Besides the components, it also migrates **stylesheets** (CSS imports →
   `@allxsmith/bestax-bulma/bestax.css`; SCSS `@import 'bulma/bulma'` + `$var` overrides
   → `@use 'bulma/sass' with (…)` plus the bestax extras) and **package.json**.
   Flags: `--css bulma|keep` for other stylesheet targets, `--no-deps` to leave
   package.json alone. `bulma-classes` is the exception: it defaults to `--css keep`,
   because the app's own Bulma already styles every class it converts, so its stylesheets
   and Bulma version stay unless you pass `--css bestax` or `--css bulma`.

3. **Install** — the codemod edits package.json but never runs a package manager. Resolve the
   retained imports first: a component with no bestax equivalent keeps a trimmed,
   TODO-annotated import of the source library, which the manifest step has just removed — so a
   clean install leaves those unresolvable. The report names them in a `deps` entry.

   ```sh
   npm install   # or pnpm/yarn
   ```

   The report groups its entries by rule. `deps` covers every package.json edit —
   what was removed, added, or left for you to decide; `imports` covers a source
   import the codemod could not rewrite and left in place; `unsupported-file` names
   a file type it cannot parse (`.vue`, `.astro`) that still imports the source;
   `value-reference` marks a component used as a value rather than as JSX. Rules
   named `component:X` and `prop:y` are per-component and per-prop, and each is
   documented in the per-source `references/` pages.

   The report's `peer-deps` entries predict install failures: bestax-bulma needs
   **React 18/19** (react-bulma-components also ran on 17, while rbx and bloomer peer-depended
   on **React 16** — upgrade react/react-dom first) and its optional Font Awesome peer wants
   **FA ≥ 6.7** (an app pinned to FA 5 either upgrades or installs with
   `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`).

4. **Resolve every TODO**: `grep -rn "TODO(bestax-migrate)" src/`. Each comment names the
   prop/component and a hint. Recipes for every recurring case are in
   `references/<source>/unmappables.md`. Before writing a component by hand, look it up in
   `references/<source>/component-map.md` and its classes in `references/<source>/prop-map.md`:
   they name the component and the prop for each class, which the library's type declarations
   only tell you slowly. For form markup (`.field`, `.control`, inputs, selects), load the
   `bestax-form` skill too: it covers the label, `id` and help-text wiring. Delete each comment
   as you resolve it.

5. **Finish the stylesheet layer** — flagged Sass cases (computed variables,
   indented-syntax `.sass` files), CSS flavor choice, and Bulma 0.9→1 styling changes:
   follow [references/css-migration.md](references/css-migration.md).

6. **Finish**: typecheck/build, and review the rendered app side by side against the
   pre-migration UI.

## What the codemod handles vs. flags

Every export of every supported source has a mapping entry, held to that library's real export
surface by a coverage test. Imports (named, namespace, and destructuring), component renames,
prop renames and value conversions, breakpoint objects, CSS/SCSS stylesheet imports, and
package.json dependencies convert automatically.

It flags with `TODO(bestax-migrate)` instead of guessing: components with no bestax equivalent,
controlled APIs whose shape differs, breakpoints bestax has no prop for, dynamic prop values it
can't rewrite, and props with no counterpart. Files in formats it can't parse (`.astro`,
`.vue`, `.svelte`, `.mdx`) that import the source library are reported as `unsupported-file` —
migrate those by hand with the component map. Never "fix" a TODO by silencing it — convert the
code per the references, or deliberately keep the old markup with `className` styling.

### Source-specific headlines

- **react-bulma-components**: all 32 v4 components are mapped. `Element` and `Tile` have no
  bestax equivalent; `renderAs` becomes `as` where supported.
- **rbx**: migrating removes rbx itself — it pinned `bulma@0.7.5` as a direct
  dependency plus `bulma-badge`, `bulma-divider`, `bulma-pageloader` and `bulma-tooltip`, so
  the app can finally choose its own Bulma version. rbx's badge and tooltip _helper props_
  become real wrapping `<Badge>` / `<Tooltip>` components. Its `as` is universal, bestax's is
  not. Because rbx pinned Bulma 0.7.5, you cross **two** Bulma majors — expect more visual
  drift than the 0.9 → 1 guide alone describes.
- **bulma-classes**: there is no library to remove. An element converts only when the bestax
  component renders the same markup (tag, classes, attributes), so a converted page renders
  the same HTML; everything else stays as written, with a TODO when there is something to
  decide. Static class strings convert, and so does a `clsx` or `classnames` call of strings
  and conditional classes, where a condition on a flag becomes its prop (`isLoading={busy}`);
  any other computed className gets `dynamic-class:<Target>`, naming the component the element
  would become. Files a Next.js
  App Router may render as server components are left alone (`rsc`), and the manifest gains
  `@allxsmith/bestax-bulma` while the app's Bulma and stylesheets stay (the default
  `--css keep`). Its rules are `kind:<name>` shaped; see
  `references/bulma-classes/unmappables.md`.
- **bloomer**: every export is a flat name and most become dotted bestax compounds
  (`CardHeaderTitle` → `Card.Header.Title`). Most of its `is*` booleans already are bestax's
  (`isActive` becomes `active` where bestax names it so; `isFullWidth` becomes `isFullwidth`
  where bestax has the prop); the work is in `isSize`/`isColor`/`isAlign` (renamed per component), the `isDisplay`/`isHidden`
  helpers (flattened, arrays and objects included), `tag` (→ `as` where bestax has one) and
  `render` (always a TODO). Its icons are className-based and Font Awesome 4 — the biggest
  visual risk, see `references/bloomer/unmappables.md`. The app declared its own Bulma 0.6,
  which the codemod bumps; there is no pinned Bulma to free.

## Rules

- The codemod is safe to re-run after partial manual work: a library source only touches files
  that still import the library, and `bulma-classes` skips elements that are already
  components and never repeats a TODO it already wrote.
- Don't downgrade converted props back to the old names; bestax uses `is*` booleans
  (`isLoading`), string size unions (`textSize="4"`), and `as` rather than `renderAs`.
- If a component the app uses isn't in the component map, it wasn't part of that library's
  public API — check for a local wrapper component and migrate its internals instead.
