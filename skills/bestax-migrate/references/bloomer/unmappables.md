# Recipes for every TODO(bestax-migrate) the bloomer codemod leaves

Ordered by how often they appear when the codemod runs over bloomer's own documentation.
Resolve the comment, then delete it. Never silence a TODO without converting the code.

## `component:Icon`, `component:PanelIcon` — Font Awesome 4 classes

bloomer's `Icon` put the icon-font classes on its own `className`, and its era was Font Awesome 4. Classes the parser can read — Font Awesome 5/6 (`fas fa-home`, `fa-solid fa-home`) and MDI
(`mdi mdi-account`) — become bestax's props automatically:

```jsx
<Icon className="fas fa-home" isSize="large" />
<Icon name="home" library="fa" variant="solid" size="large" />
```

Modifier classes the library documents (`fa-spin`, `fa-lg`, `mdi-24px`) become bestax's
`features`. Anything else — FA4's `fa fa-home` above all, or an app's own class beside the icon
— is moved onto an `<i>` child, which renders exactly what bloomer rendered, and flagged: bestax's optional Font Awesome peer is **6.7+**, where
many v4 names changed and brand icons moved to `variant="brands"`. Either keep FA4 loaded, or
convert to the prop form:

```jsx
<Icon><i className="fa fa-github" aria-hidden="true" /></Icon>
<Icon name="github" library="fa" variant="brands" />
```

`library` is `fa` | `mdi` | `ion` | `material-icons` | `material-symbols`. `PanelIcon` has the
same `className` API and converts the same way. An `Icon` with no `className` and no children
is flagged too — it gets an empty `<i>` child so it compiles until you set a `name` or a child —
and so is a `className` that is not a string (`prop:className`). An `Icon` written with children
is flagged as well: bloomer never rendered them — beside a `className` they are removed (the
classes win), without one they are kept and bestax will render them.

## `component:Nav` — Bulma 0.4's nav

`Nav`, `NavLeft`, `NavCenter`, `NavRight`, `NavToggle` and `NavItem` (`component:NavLeft`,
`component:NavCenter`, `component:NavRight`, `component:NavToggle`, `component:NavItem`) are
Bulma 0.4's `.nav`, which Bulma removed in 0.5 — bloomer kept the components, but no stylesheet
you can install today styles them. Rebuild on `Navbar`:

```jsx
<Nav><NavLeft><NavItem isActive>Home</NavItem></NavLeft><NavToggle /></Nav>

<Navbar>
  <Navbar.Brand><Navbar.Burger /></Navbar.Brand>
  <Navbar.Menu><Navbar.Start><Navbar.Item active>Home</Navbar.Item></Navbar.Start></Navbar.Menu>
</Navbar>
```

## `component:Tile` — Bulma v1 removed tiles

Use Grid and Cell. `Tile isAncestor` becomes `<Grid>`, `isParent`/`isChild` become `<Cell>`,
and `isSize={n}` becomes a column span:

```jsx
<Tile isAncestor><Tile isParent isSize={4}><Tile isChild>x</Tile></Tile></Tile>
<Grid><Cell colSpan={4}>x</Cell></Grid>
```

## `component:Modal` — what carries over

bloomer's `Modal` was an inert shell: `isActive` toggled the class and nothing else. bestax's
`Modal` closes on Escape (calling `onClose`), locks body scroll, and traps focus **by default**,
and renders inline unless `portal` is set. So every conversion changes behaviour, and every one
is flagged. Pass `onClose` to get the close-on-Escape and background behaviour:

```jsx
<Modal active={open} onClose={() => setOpen(false)}>
```

or keep bloomer's inert behaviour with `closeOnEscape={false} lockScroll={false}`. Add
`portal` if the modal must escape a transformed ancestor.

## `component:Dropdown` and its parts

bestax's `Dropdown` takes a `label` and renders its own trigger and menu, so bloomer's
`DropdownTrigger`, `DropdownMenu` and `DropdownContent` have nothing to become
(`component:DropdownTrigger`, `component:DropdownMenu`, `component:DropdownContent`). Keep the
`<DropdownItem>`s, which become `<Dropdown.Item>`:

```jsx
<Dropdown isActive isAlign="right">
  <DropdownTrigger><Button>Open</Button></DropdownTrigger>
  <DropdownMenu><DropdownContent>
    <DropdownItem href="/a">A</DropdownItem>
  </DropdownContent></DropdownMenu>
</Dropdown>

<Dropdown label="Open" active right>
  <Dropdown.Item href="/a">A</Dropdown.Item>
</Dropdown>
```

bestax's `Dropdown.Item` renders an `<a>` by default and takes that anchor's props, so the
`href` carries over. It keeps one only where the element it renders is the anchor: on
`as="div"` or `as="button"` the attribute is dropped (`prop:href`), and the item is a link
again if you drop the `as`.
`isHoverable` → `hoverable`, `isActive` → `active` carry over on the `Dropdown` itself.

## `prop:tag` — polymorphism

bestax declares `as` on only some components (the list is in [prop-map.md](prop-map.md)).
Elsewhere, render the element you wanted directly, or move the bestax component inside it:

```jsx
<Box tag="section">…</Box>
<section><Box>…</Box></section>
```

A dynamic `tag` on a component that becomes plain markup is flagged the same way — the plain
element takes bloomer's default tag.

## `prop:as` — a tag the component does not render

Several bestax components accept `as` but narrow it to the tags Bulma's markup allows there, so
a literal `tag` outside that union (`<Media tag="section">`, `<Control tag="span">`) becomes a
`prop:as` TODO listing the tags that component does render. Wrap the component in the element
you wanted, or restructure.

## `prop:href` — a link needs the anchor

bestax gives an element the attributes of the tag `as` names, so an `href` belongs on an `<a>`
or on a custom component you pass to `as`, never on another intrinsic tag. bloomer's `MenuLink`, `NavbarLink` and the components that become plain
markup rendered their `tag` whatever `href` said, so `<MenuLink href="/x" tag="span">` really
was a `<span href="/x">` — an attribute no browser acts on. The element stays, the dead
attribute goes:

```jsx
<MenuLink href="/x" tag="span">Home</MenuLink>
<Menu.Item as="span">Home</Menu.Item>
```

Drop the `tag` where the link was the point. On the components that switched to an `<a>` on
`href` the codemod does that for you — see [prop-map.md](prop-map.md).

Most targets take no `href` at all. It lives on `Menu.Item`, `Navbar.Item`, `Navbar.Link`,
`Panel.Block`, `Dropdown.Item` and the three `Pagination` controls, which render an `<a>` unless
told otherwise,
and on `Button` and `Level.Item` once `as="a"` names one — those two render a `<button>` and a
`<div>` by default, and drop the attribute. Everywhere else the codemod removes it.

`Dropdown.Item` is the one to read twice: it accepts `as="a" | "div" | "button"` and takes the
props of whichever you name, so the default `<a>` keeps an `href` and the other two do not.
Drop the `as` to make it a link again; inside the `<button>` form an `<a>` would nest
interactive content, so navigate in `onClick` there.

## `prop:target`, `prop:download`, `prop:hrefLang`, `prop:ping`, `prop:referrerPolicy`, `prop:media`

`target`, `download`, `hrefLang`, `ping`, `referrerPolicy` and `media` follow the element the same way
`href` does, and they are invalid on the wrong one whether or not an `href` is beside them —
`<Navbar.Link as="span" target="_blank">` does not compile on its own. Each is judged against
the element that actually renders, not as a group, so a `referrerPolicy` on an `<img>` or a
`target` on a `<form>` stays where it is legal. Where one is removed the TODO quotes it. Put it
on an `<a>` inside, or make the element one that takes it.

`rel` is never touched: React declares it on `HTMLAttributes`, so it is valid on every element.

A component can be narrower than its element. One that takes no `href` at any `as` takes none of
these either. `Level.Item` is not narrower: it declares the anchor's whole attribute surface at
every `as` and forwards it only on the `<a>`, so all of these survive at `as="a"` and none of
them reaches a `<p>` or a `<div>`.

## `prop:type` — a `<button>` item that no longer submits its form

`Navbar.Item`, `Navbar.Link`, `Menu.Item` and `Dropdown.Item` write `type="button"` on the
`<button>` an `as` makes them render, whenever the element sets no `type` or one HTML doesn't
define. A plain `<button>` with neither submits the form around it, so an item you rendered as a
button with `tag="button"` stops submitting once migrated. The codemod can't tell whether one sits
in a form, so each gets a TODO:

```jsx
<NavbarItem tag="button">Search</NavbarItem>
<Navbar.Item as="button">Search</Navbar.Item>
```

Add `type="submit"` if it should still submit, or `type="button"` to say it shouldn't, then
delete the comment. An item whose `type` is written out as `button`, `submit` or `reset`, or
comes from a spread or an expression, gets no TODO.

## `prop:render` — the render prop

bloomer's `render` handed the computed props (`className` included) to your own renderer:

```jsx
<Button isColor="info" render={props => <MyButton {...props} />} />
```

bestax has no render-prop escape hatch. Render the bestax component and put your element inside
it, or — if you need the classes on your own element — call `useBulmaClasses` in it:

```jsx
<Button color="info" as={MyButton} />
```

`Button`, `Navbar.Item`, `Navbar.Link` and `Menu.Item` take `as` as a custom component, which
covers the common "render as a router link" case.

## `component:Heading` — Bulma v1 dropped `.heading`

bloomer's `Heading` is Bulma's small-caps label. It becomes the plain `<p className="heading">`
bloomer rendered, but Bulma v1 no longer ships styles for that class, so restyle it:

```jsx
<Heading>Label</Heading>
<Title as="p" size={6} textTransform="uppercase" textWeight="semibold">Label</Title>
```

## `prop:isFullWidth` — not a universal helper in bestax

bloomer accepted `isFullWidth` on everything; Bulma's `is-fullwidth` only means something on a
few elements. Where bestax has a prop for it (`Button`, `Select`, `Table`, `Tabs`), it becomes
`isFullwidth`. Elsewhere, drop it, or add `className="is-fullwidth"` if your
own CSS styled the class.

## Modifiers bestax has no prop for — converted to classes

Bulma v1 still ships every one of these, so the codemod writes the class into `className`
instead of leaving a TODO: `Hero isBold` → `className="is-bold"`, `isHalfHeight` →
`is-halfheight`, `Media isSize="large"` → `is-large`, `Subtitle isSpaced` → `is-spaced`,
`Input isActive` → `is-active`, `NavbarLink isActive` → `is-active`, `PageLink`/`PageControl`/
`PageEllipsis` `isActive`/`isFocused`, `PanelBlock isWrapped` → `is-wrapped`, `LevelItem
isFlexible` → `is-flexible`, `NavbarDropdown`/`NavbarDivider` `isBoxed` → `is-boxed`. The same
goes for a universal helper on a part that takes no helper props (`Pagination.Previous`/`Next`/
`Ellipsis`, `Navbar.Dropdown`/`DropdownMenu`/`Divider`, `Panel.Heading`/`Tabs`/`Block`,
`Tabs.List`/`Item`, `Message.Header`/`Body`, the `Modal` parts): `isPulled="right"` →
`is-pulled-right`, `isMarginless` → `m-0`, `isHidden="mobile"` → `is-hidden-mobile`. A dynamic
value, or a dynamic `className` the class cannot be spliced into, is flagged with the class to add.

## Props with no counterpart

Each of these raises a TODO. Most are left on the element for you to resolve; the `href` rows
are the exception — bestax types no `href` onto the element these ended up on, so the codemod
removes the attribute and the TODO quotes what it was:

| prop                      | on                                                                                 | what to do                                                                              |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `isHoverable`             | `NavbarItem` without `hasDropdown`                                                 | move to the `Navbar.Dropdown`, or `className="is-hoverable"`                            |
| `hasAddons="fullwidth"`   | `Field`                                                                            | `hasAddons` plus `className="has-addons-fullwidth"`                                     |
| `isAlign`                 | `TabList`                                                                          | set `align` on the `<Tabs>` — Bulma aligns the container                                |
| `isGrid`                  | `Columns`                                                                          | Bulma removed `columns.is-grid` in 0.5; use `isMultiline` with sized columns, or `Grid` |
| `href`                    | `CardFooterItem`, `CardHeaderIcon`, `Delete`                                       | put an `<a>` inside, or handle it in `onClick`                                          |
| `href` beside a `tag`     | `MenuLink`, `NavbarLink`, and anything that becomes plain markup                   | the tag bloomer rendered was no anchor, so the `href` did nothing; drop the `tag`       |
| `href={expr}` (dynamic)   | `Button`, `LevelItem` and the other components that switched to an `<a>` on `href` | resolved to the anchor; render the other element by hand where the `href` is empty      |
| `href`                    | `NavbarItem hasDropdown`                                                           | bestax's `Navbar.Dropdown` is the container; put the `href` on the `Navbar.Link` inside |
| `isRatio` beside `isSize` | `Image`                                                                            | bestax's one `size` took the fixed size; restore the ratio if that was the point        |

## `component:MenuLink`, `component:Breadcrumb`, `component:Page` — lists bestax renders itself

bestax's `Menu.Item` renders its own `<li><a>`, its `Breadcrumb` its own `<ul>`, and its
`Pagination.Link`/`Pagination.Ellipsis` their own `<li>`. bloomer's docs wrote those elements by
hand, so the codemod folds a literal `<li>` around a `MenuLink`, a literal `<ul>` inside a
`Breadcrumb`, and a `Page` around a single link away — carrying their attributes. It flags the
shapes it cannot fold: a `MenuLink` sharing its `<li>` with other content, a `<ul>` carrying
attributes, and a `Page` whose link sits in an expression or beside siblings — remove the wrapper
by hand, or the lists nest.

## `prop:isLink` — beside `isColor`

`isLink` is Bulma's `is-link` colour. Alone it becomes `color="link"`; beside an `isColor` there
are two colours for bestax's one `color` prop — pick one.

## `prop:isDisplay`, `prop:isHidden`, `prop:isSize`, `prop:isOffset` — dynamic helper values

The three-shape helpers flatten only from literals. A dynamic value is dropped (bestax has no
prop of that name, so leaving it would be a type error) and flagged; set the matching bestax
prop conditionally:

```jsx
<Box isHidden={collapsed} />
<Box visibility={collapsed ? 'hidden' : undefined} />
```

`Column`'s `isSize`/`isOffset` follow the same rule, and a `touch` key has no `sizeTouch`
counterpart in bestax (only `isNarrowTouch`) — Bulma keeps the `is-*-touch` classes, so use
`className`.

## `value-reference` — a component used as a value

`const Wrapped = Box` and `{ Subtitle }` are rewritten to the bestax binding (`Hero.Foot`,
`SubTitle`) when the target is a plain rename, and `export { Subtitle }` becomes
`export { SubTitle as Subtitle }` so the public name survives. A re-export of a component whose
bestax counterpart is a member of a compound (`export { CardHeader }` → `Card.Header`) cannot be
expressed and is flagged; so is a barrel `export { X } from 'bloomer'` (`imports`) and a
namespace import used as a plain value (`const { Box } = B`), through which nothing was
migrated. A retained component (`Tile`, the `Nav` family,
`withHelpersModifiers`) used as a value keeps the bloomer import with this flag: migrate the
usage by hand. `withHelpersModifiers` in particular has nothing to become — every bestax
component already takes the helper props, and a custom component gets them from
`useBulmaClasses`.

## `imports` — a bloomer import the codemod left alone

A default import (`import Bloomer from 'bloomer'`) never worked — bloomer has no default
export — and a deep import (`bloomer/lib/elements/Box`) reaches compiled internals the mapping
does not know. Convert either to a named import from `'bloomer'` and re-run the codemod.

## `plain-element` — helper props on markup that became plain HTML

When a component becomes plain markup (`Help`, `Label`, `PanelTab`, …), bloomer's helper props
on it have no home and are dropped with this flag. Re-apply them as classes
(`className="is-pulled-right"`), or wrap the element in a bestax `Box`/`Block` that takes them.

## Dynamic values

Any prop whose value the codemod cannot read — `isColor={c}`, `isNext={n}`, `hasIcons={sides}`,
`tag={t}`, `isTransparent={t}`, `isFullHeight={f}`, `isNormal={n}` — is either renamed as-is (when the rename is unconditional) or flagged with the
specific prop to set. The comment names it.
