# Recipes for every TODO(bestax-migrate) the codemod leaves

Work through `grep -rn "TODO(bestax-migrate)" src/` with these. Delete each comment once
the site is converted.

## `unsupported-file` — `.astro` / `.vue` / `.svelte` / `.mdx` imports

The codemod can't parse these formats, so files in them that import
react-bulma-components are reported (not rewritten). Migrate them by hand: swap the
import to `@allxsmith/bestax-bulma` and apply the same renames the component/prop maps
describe — the mapping is identical, only the rewriting is manual.

## `peer-deps` — install-blocking version conflicts

Reported from package.json, not a code TODO. bestax-bulma's peers: **React ^18 || ^19**
(upgrade react/react-dom before installing — RBC v4 also ran on 17) and optional
**@fortawesome/fontawesome-free ^6.7 || ^7** (FA 5 apps: upgrade, or
`npm install --legacy-peer-deps` and keep FA 5 for your own `<i>` tags).

## `component:Element` — no generic element

bestax has no `Element`. Pick the semantic component (`Block`, `Box`, `Content`, …) that
matches the usage, or plain JSX with classes:

```tsx
// Before
<Element renderAs="span" textColor="grey" m={2}>…</Element>
// After
<Span textColor="grey" m="2">…</Span>   // bestax exports Span/Paragraph/Strong/etc.
```

## `component:Tile` — Bulma v1 replaced tiles with Grid

Convert ancestor/parent/child tile trees to `Grid`/`Cell` (docs:
https://bestax.io/docs/api/grid):

```tsx
// Before
<Tile kind="ancestor"><Tile kind="parent" size={8}><Tile kind="child">A</Tile></Tile></Tile>
// After
<Grid><Cell colSpan={8}>A</Cell></Grid>
```

Match the old proportions with `Cell` span props; tiles' `vertical` becomes grid flow.

## Controlled `Dropdown` (`value` / `onChange`, `Dropdown.Item value`)

bestax `Dropdown` is compositional — you own the selection state:

```tsx
const [choice, setChoice] = useState('a');
<Dropdown label={labels[choice]} closeOnClick>
  <Dropdown.Item active={choice === 'a'} onClick={() => setChoice('a')}>
    First
  </Dropdown.Item>
  <Dropdown.Item active={choice === 'b'} onClick={() => setChoice('b')}>
    Second
  </Dropdown.Item>
</Dropdown>;
```

## `Pagination` extras (`showFirstLast`, `showPrevNext`, `autoHide`)

bestax `Pagination` renders from `total`/`current`/`onPageChange` when it has no children:
Previous, Next and the page links, with an ellipsis for each run it skips. The codemod writes
`delta` as `siblingCount` (the pages on each side of the current one) and `next`/`previous` as
`nextLabel`/`previousLabel`. It always shows Previous and Next, and the first and last pages
(`boundaryCount` of each, 1 by default), so drop `showPrevNext` and `showFirstLast`, or compose
the parts (`Pagination.Previous`, `Pagination.List`, `Pagination.Link`) by hand for a
different layout. Render conditionally instead of `autoHide` (`{total > 1 && <Pagination …/>}`).

Two of RBC's defaults differ, and a Pagination that doesn't write them gets no TODO: RBC hides
itself at a `total` of 1 (`autoHide` is on by default), and shows no first and last pages unless
`showFirstLast` is set. bestax renders a one-page Pagination with both ends disabled, and shows
the first and last pages, so check pagination that relied on either. RBC's `delta={0}` renders
no page links at all, while `siblingCount={0}` still shows the current, first and last pages, so
that one value gets a `prop:delta` TODO rather than converting.

## `Modal` (`closeOnBlur`, `showClose`)

`closeOnEsc` is not in this list: bestax has `closeOnEscape` (default `true`) and the codemod
renames it, so `closeOnEsc={false}` keeps suppressing Escape rather than inheriting the default.

The other two depend on which form the migrated modal lands in. bestax's `Modal` supplies a
background wired to `onClose` and a floating close button only in its **legacy** form — plain
children, no compound child. A `Modal.Content` or `Modal.Card` child (which is what almost every
RBC modal has) selects the **compound** form, and that renders only the children you wrote:

```tsx
<Modal active={show} onClose={close}>
  <Modal.Background onClick={close} />
  <Modal.Content>…</Modal.Content>
  <Modal.Close variant="floating" onClick={close} />
</Modal>
```

So `closeOnBlur` and `showClose={true}` mean "add those two children"; passing either as `false`
means "drop the prop", since the compound form gives you neither unless you ask.

## `responsive` — `touch` / `untilWidescreen` / `untilFullhd` / `{ only: true }` breakpoints

No bestax helper-prop variants exist. Use Bulma classes directly:
`className="is-hidden-touch"`, `is-flex-tablet-only`, etc. (all still exist in Bulma v1).

## Icon children the parser couldn't read

bestax `Icon` renders from `name` + `library` (+ `variant` for Font Awesome styles):

```tsx
<Icon name="github" library="fa" variant="brands" ariaLabel="GitHub" />
```

For icon fonts other than Font Awesome/MDI, see the `bestax-icons` skill.

## Dynamic values (`state={x}`, `textSize={n}`, `align={side}`, …)

The codemod only rewrites literals. Convert the expression at its source, e.g.:

```tsx
// Before: <Button state={hovered ? 'hover' : undefined}>
<Button isHovered={hovered}>
// Before: <Block textSize={n}>
<Block textSize={String(n) as '1' | '2' | '3' | '4' | '5' | '6' | '7'}>
```

## `prop:color` — Button shade colors (`black-bis`, `grey-light`, …) and `isSelected`

bestax `Button` colors are the semantic set + `text`/`ghost`. For shades use
`bgColor`/`textColor` (they accept the full palette incl. shades), and replace
`isSelected` with `className="is-selected"` inside grouped buttons.

## `colorVariant` / Hero `gradient` / Hero `halfheight`

- `colorVariant="light"` → `isLight` where supported (Button, Notification), otherwise a
  shade: `bgColor="primary-90"`.
- Bulma v1 removed `is-bold` hero gradients — delete `gradient` or restyle with CSS.
- `halfheight` has no bestax size; use `size="medium"` or a CSS height.

## `domRef`

bestax components don't take `domRef`, but many forward a plain `ref` — the form controls,
plus `Avatar`, `Button`, `Carousel`, `CarouselItem`, `Dialog`, `Dropdown`, `Link`,
`LinkButton`, `Loader`, `Menu.Item`, `Modal`, `Navbar`, `Navbar.Burger`, `Navbar.Dropdown`,
`Navbar.Item`, `Navbar.Link`, `Sidebar` and `Toast`. On those, rename `domRef` to
`ref` and it works; do not restructure the markup. "The form controls" means the inputs
themselves: the `Field`, `Field.Label`, `Field.Body`, `Checkboxes` and `Radios` wrappers
around them forward nothing, and `Field` is a target this codemod emits.

Everywhere else the rename is not enough, and the two React majors differ: React 18 drops the
ref and logs "Function components cannot be given refs", while React 19 passes it through as
an ordinary prop, so it settles wherever the component spreads its rest props with nothing
logged. bestax supports both, so attach the ref to a DOM element inside, or wrap the component
in a `<div ref={…}>`.

The codemod does not do that rename for you: `domRef` is flagged on every component, so the
TODO names both cases and you pick. `Navbar.Dropdown` is the trap, and it cuts both ways —
RBC's is the menu itself, so it maps to bestax's `Navbar.DropdownMenu`, which forwards no ref;
bestax reserves the name `Navbar.Dropdown` for the outer container, which is what the
`Navbar.Item` wrapping your dropdown becomes, and that one _does_ forward one. So after the
codemod runs, read the target name on the line, not the one you wrote.

`Button` has the same shape of trap. `<Button remove>` is Bulma's delete cross, so it migrates
to `<Delete>`, a plain function component that forwards no ref — even though `Button` itself
does. The codemod detects that case and replaces the general advice with a TODO naming
`Delete`, so the message on the line is the one to trust.

## `prop:as` — a tag the component does not render

Several bestax components accept `as` but narrow it to the tags Bulma's markup allows there, so
a literal `renderAs` outside that union (`<Media renderAs="section">`, `<Footer
renderAs="section">`) becomes a `prop:as` TODO listing the tags that component does render. Wrap
the component in the element you wanted, or restructure. See the `as` section of
[prop-map.md](prop-map.md) for which components accept it at all.

## `prop:href` — a link needs the anchor

bestax gives an element the attributes of the tag `as` names, so an `href` belongs on an `<a>`
or on a custom component you pass to `as`, never on another intrinsic tag. RBC let the two
disagree, and the browser ignored the result: `<Menu.List.Item renderAs="span" href="/x">`
rendered a `<span>` that navigated nowhere. The element stays, the dead attribute goes:

```jsx
<Menu.List.Item renderAs="span" href="/x">Home</Menu.List.Item>
<Menu.Item as="span">Home</Menu.Item>
```

Most targets take no `href` at all. It lives on `Menu.Item`, `Navbar.Item`, `Navbar.Link`,
`Panel.Block`, `Dropdown.Item` and the three `Pagination` controls, which render an `<a>` unless
told otherwise,
and on `Button` and `Level.Item` once `as="a"` names one — those two render a `<button>` and a
`<div>` by default, and drop the attribute. Everywhere else the codemod removes it.

`Dropdown.Item` is the one to read twice: it accepts `as="a" | "div" | "button"` and takes the
props of whichever you name, so the default `<a>` keeps an `href` and the other two do not.
Drop the `as` to make it a link again; inside the `<button>` form an `<a>` would nest
interactive content, so navigate in `onClick` there.

## `prop:target`, `prop:download`, `prop:hrefLang`, `prop:ping`, `prop:referrerPolicy`, `prop:media`

`target`, `download`, `hrefLang`, `ping`, `referrerPolicy` and `media` follow the element the same way
`href` does, and they are invalid on the wrong one whether or not an `href` is beside them —
`<Navbar.Link as="span" target="_blank">` does not compile on its own. Each is judged against
the element that actually renders, not as a group, so a `referrerPolicy` on an `<img>` or a
`target` on a `<form>` stays where it is legal. Where one is removed the TODO quotes it. Put it
on an `<a>` inside, or make the element one that takes it.

`rel` is never touched: React declares it on `HTMLAttributes`, so it is valid on every element.

A component can be narrower than its element. One that takes no `href` at any `as` takes none of
these either. `Level.Item` is not narrower: it declares the anchor's whole attribute surface at
every `as` and forwards it only on the `<a>`, so all of these survive at `as="a"` and none of
them reaches a `<p>` or a `<div>`.

## `prop:type` — a `<button>` item that no longer submits its form

`Navbar.Item`, `Navbar.Link`, `Menu.Item` and `Dropdown.Item` write `type="button"` on the
`<button>` an `as` makes them render, whenever the element sets no `type` or one HTML doesn't
define. A plain `<button>` with neither submits the form around it, so an item you rendered as a
button with `renderAs="button"` stops submitting once migrated. The codemod can't tell whether one sits
in a form, so each gets a TODO:

```jsx
<Navbar.Item renderAs="button">Search</Navbar.Item>
<Navbar.Item as="button">Search</Navbar.Item>
```

Add `type="submit"` if it should still submit, or `type="button"` to say it shouldn't, then
delete the comment. An item whose `type` is written out as `button`, `submit` or `reset`, or
comes from a spread or an expression, gets no TODO.

## Helper props dropped from plain-element replacements

Where the codemod produced a plain element (`Form.Label` → `<label>`, `Breadcrumb.Item` →
`<li>`, `Table.Container` fallback `<div>`), Bulma helper props were dropped with a TODO.
Re-express them as classes: `m={2}` → `className="m-2"`, `textAlign="center"` →
`className="has-text-centered"`.
