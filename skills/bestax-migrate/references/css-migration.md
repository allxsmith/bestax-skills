# Stylesheets: pre-1 Bulma → Bulma v1 + bestax

Every library `bestax-migrate` migrates from is pinned to a pre-1 Bulma: react-bulma-components
to 0.9.x, rbx to 0.7.5, and a bloomer app to whichever 0.6 it installed itself. bestax-bulma
targets Bulma v1. The codemod automates most of that
stylesheet layer; this reference explains what it did and how to finish what it flagged.

Coming from rbx or bloomer you are crossing **two** Bulma majors rather than one, so expect more
visual drift than the 0.9 → 1 notes below describe on their own.

An app that writes Bulma's classes directly (`bulma-classes`) keeps its stylesheet by
default: that source runs as `--css keep`, because the app's own Bulma already styles every
class a converted element renders, so its stylesheet imports, Sass and Bulma version stay as
they were. Moving to Bulma v1 is a separate step, taken with `--css bestax` or `--css bulma`.
From a 0.9.x it then follows these notes as written; on Bulma v1 already, only the bundle
choice below applies.

## What the codemod already did (`--css bestax`, the library sources' default)

- **CSS imports**: `bulma/css/bulma(.min).css` and v3-era
  the source library's own CSS imports (`react-bulma-components/dist/*.css`,
  `rbx/index.css`) became the recommended combined bundle
  `@allxsmith/bestax-bulma/bestax.css` (Bulma v1 + the bestax extras that themed
  Radio/Checkbox and the advanced form controls need). A separate `extras.css` import
  next to it is collapsed.
  **Visual note**: `bestax.css` ships with `$primary` set to bestax blue (`#1e6b99`),
  not Bulma's stock turquoise — `is-primary` surfaces (hero, navbar, buttons) change
  color. Keep the stock Bulma look with `--css bulma`, or set your own brand color via
  `--bulma-primary-*` CSS variables / a Sass build.

- **SCSS files**: Bulma 0.9's `@import 'bulma/bulma.sass'` (plus preceding
  `$var: value !default;` overrides) became Bulma v1 module syntax, with simple literal
  overrides folded in:

  ```scss
  @use 'bulma/sass' with (
    $primary: #ff6b35,
    $family-primary: (
      'Nunito',
      sans-serif,
    )
  );
  @use '@allxsmith/bestax-bulma/scss/extras';
  ```

  A comma-valued override (a font-family stack) is wrapped in parens so Dart Sass
  reads it as one list value, not extra arguments to `with (…)`.

  0.9 `_all` aggregator imports (`bulma/sass/elements/_all`) became directory modules
  (`@use 'bulma/sass/elements';`). Relative node_modules paths
  (`@import '../../node_modules/bulma/bulma'`, common under Parcel) keep their prefix,
  and the extras `@use` then points at the shipped file
  (`…/node_modules/@allxsmith/bestax-bulma/src/scss/extras`) since such toolchains
  resolve raw paths, not package specifiers. Building Bulma v1 from Sass needs
  **dart-sass ≥ 1.79** — the codemod's node-sass replacement installs that, but check
  bundler-pinned older versions (Parcel's sass transformer pins 1.66).

  the source library's own stylesheet — any `react-bulma-components/…` or `rbx/…` specifier,
  bare, `~`-prefixed, or a relative `node_modules/` path, covering the documented v3
  entry points (`src/index.sass`, `dist/react-bulma-components(.min).css`, `rbx/rbx`) as well as
  deep partials and extensionless forms — is not a third-party extension; it's the
  library being migrated away from. It targets Bulma 0.9, not the v1 your components now
  use, and (unless `--no-deps` is passed) `package.json` no longer lists it, so the
  import can never resolve once installed. Every `--css` mode rewrites it into a real
  Bulma root rather than leaving a known-broken import — the **same shape the
  `@import 'bulma/…'` root path emits**, so a file that starts from RBC and one that
  starts from a Bulma import converge: `bestax` (default) emits
  `@use 'bulma/sass';` (folding any leading `$var` overrides above the import into
  `with (…)`) plus `@use '@allxsmith/bestax-bulma/scss/extras';`; `bulma` emits plain
  `@use 'bulma/sass';`; `keep` does the same with a TODO explaining the replacement
  (worded to match whether `--no-deps` kept the package). It deliberately does **not**
  emit the hard-configured `scss/bestax` bundle here — that bundle can't carry the
  user's own theme vars, and reconfiguring `bulma/sass` when another file already
  configures it is a hard Sass error. If the file already has its own `bulma/…` root
  (a `@use 'bulma/sass'` of its own, or a Bulma `@import` the codemod converts), the RBC
  **root/index** line (`src/index`, the bundled `dist/*.css`, or the bare specifier) is
  dropped instead of emitting a second root; in `bestax` mode the extras are added once
  alongside that existing root. A dropped RBC **deep partial** (e.g.
  `src/components/navbar.sass`) is different — `bulma/sass` doesn't necessarily carry a
  given partial's styles, so it gets a `// TODO(bestax-migrate)` and a report entry
  ("port any styles it carried beyond Bulma's own by hand") rather than vanishing silently.

- **package.json**: the source library removed, `@allxsmith/bestax-bulma` added, a declared
  pre-1.0 `bulma` raised to `^1.0.4` (or `bulma` added when sources still import `bulma/…`
  directly). For rbx, the four `bulma-*` extensions it pinned are **reported** for you to
  remove, not deleted — a manifest entry is a deliberate declaration, and the same goes for
  their CSS imports in source files (kept, with a TODO each),
  and dead `node-sass` replaced with dart `sass`. Run the package manager's install
  afterwards — the codemod never installs anything.

Flag reference: `--css bulma` keeps plain `bulma/css/bulma.min.css` and adds a separate
`@allxsmith/bestax-bulma/extras.css` import; `--css keep` leaves stylesheets alone;
`--no-deps` skips the package.json step.

## Finishing the flagged cases

- **Computed Sass variables** (`$primary: lighten(#333, 10%);` and anything with
  functions/interpolation): move them into the `with (…)` configuration by hand —
  `with (…)` values must be compile-time literals, so resolve the expression or compute
  it after the `@use`.
- **Indented-syntax `.sass` files**: flagged, not rewritten. Convert `@import` lines to
  `@use "bulma/sass" with (…)` manually (same rules as SCSS, minus semicolons/braces).
- **Unknown 0.9 partial paths**: the v1 sass tree is `bulma/sass/{utilities,base,
elements,form,components,grid,layout,helpers,themes}` with leaf partials like
  `bulma/sass/utilities/initial-variables` — find the equivalent module and `@use` it.
- **Third-party Bulma extensions** (`bulma-checkradio`, `bulma-switch`, `bulma-tooltip`,
  …): flagged, left in place. These are 0.9-era add-ons — check each one's Bulma v1
  compatibility. Class-based usage (`className="is-checkradio"`) keeps needing the
  extension; usage that migrated to bestax components (Radio, Checkbox, the advanced
  form controls) is already styled by the bestax extras, so the import can go.
  the source library's own stylesheet is never flagged this way (see above) — only
  packages actually named `bulma-*` are.

## Choosing a CSS flavor (optional)

`bestax.css` is right for almost every app. Alternatives (swap the import specifier):

| Import                                                            | Use when                                                                                    |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `@allxsmith/bestax-bulma/versions/bestax-prefixed.css`            | class conflicts with another framework — pair with `<ConfigProvider classPrefix="bestax-">` |
| `@allxsmith/bestax-bulma/versions/bestax-no-helpers.css`          | smallest CSS; **helper props like `mt="4"` stop working**                                   |
| `@allxsmith/bestax-bulma/versions/bestax-no-helpers-prefixed.css` | both of the above                                                                           |
| `@allxsmith/bestax-bulma/versions/bestax-no-dark-mode.css`        | light-mode-only product                                                                     |

## Custom SCSS builds with bestax

Do **not** `@use '@allxsmith/bestax-bulma/scss/bestax'` when you need your own
`$variable` overrides — that entry pre-configures `bulma/sass` and Sass forbids
configuring a module twice. The correct pairing (what the codemod emits) is:

```scss
@use 'bulma/sass' with (
  $primary: …
);
@use '@allxsmith/bestax-bulma/scss/extras';
```

Per-component partials also exist (`@use '@allxsmith/bestax-bulma/scss/components/dialog';`,
`…/scss/form/autocomplete`, …) for modular builds.

## Runtime theming

Bulma v1 themes with `--bulma-*` CSS variables at runtime (dark mode is automatic).
Sass `with (…)` is for compile-time tokens; for brand/dark-mode work use the bestax
`Theme` component — see the `bestax-theming` skill and
https://bestax.io/docs/guides/getting-started/migration/bulma-0-9-to-1 for the broader
0.9 → 1 changes (Tiles → Grid, `is-bold` gradients removed, automatic dark mode).
