# Recipes for every TODO(bestax-migrate) the rbx codemod leaves

Ordered by how often they appear when the codemod runs over rbx's own documentation examples.
Resolve the comment, then delete it. Never silence a TODO without converting the code.

## `component:Icon` — the icon child

bestax's `Icon` takes a **required `name`** instead of an icon child, and rbx's docs teach the
FontAwesome component form, which carries no readable name.

```jsx
<Icon size="small"><FontAwesomeIcon icon={faHome} /></Icon>
<Icon name="home" library="fa" variant="solid" size="small" />
```

`library` is `fa` | `mdi` | `ion` | `material-icons` | `material-symbols`; `variant` is the style
(`solid`, `regular`, `brands`, …). Icon-font children the parser _can_ read
(`<i className="fas fa-home" />`) are converted automatically, with modifier classes such as
`fa-spin` carried as bestax's `features`; a child that also carries an app class of its own is
kept and flagged instead.

## `component:Tile` — Bulma v1 removed tiles

Use Grid and Cell. `Tile kind="ancestor"` becomes `<Grid>`, `kind="parent"`/`kind="child"`
become `<Cell>`, and `size={n}` becomes a column span.

```jsx
<Tile kind="ancestor"><Tile kind="parent" size={4}><Tile kind="child">x</Tile></Tile></Tile>
<Grid><Cell colSpan={4}>x</Cell></Grid>
```

## `component:File.*` — the file-input parts

bestax's `<File>` renders the whole Bulma structure itself, so `File.Label`, `File.Input`,
`File.CTA`, `File.Icon` and `File.Name` have nothing to become.

```jsx
<File hasName>
  <File.Label>
    <File.Input name="upload" />
    <File.CTA><File.Label>Choose…</File.Label></File.CTA>
    <File.Name>none</File.Name>
  </File.Label>
</File>

<File name="upload" label="Choose…" hasName />
```

## `prop:as` — polymorphism

rbx puts `as` on everything; bestax does not. Either render the tag directly, or restructure.
See the `as` section of [prop-map.md](prop-map.md) for the components that do accept it.

The same rule fires a second way: several bestax components accept `as` but narrow it to the
tags Bulma's markup allows there, so a literal outside that union (`<Control as="span">`,
`<Media as="section">`) is dropped and named. The TODO lists the tags that component renders.

## `prop:href` — a link needs the anchor

bestax gives an element the attributes of the tag `as` names, so an `href` belongs on an `<a>`
or on a custom component you pass to `as`, never on another intrinsic tag. rbx let the two disagree, and the browser ignored the result:
`<Menu.List.Item as="span" href="/x">` rendered a `<span>` that navigated nowhere.

The codemod keeps the element you asked for and drops the attribute that did nothing:

```jsx
<Menu.List.Item as="span" href="/x">Home</Menu.List.Item>
<Menu.Item as="span">Home</Menu.Item>
```

Most targets take no `href` at all. It lives on `Menu.Item`, `Navbar.Item`, `Navbar.Link`,
`Panel.Block`, `Dropdown.Item` and the three `Pagination` controls, which render an `<a>` unless
told otherwise,
and on `Button` and `Level.Item` once `as="a"` names one — those two render a `<button>` and a
`<div>` by default, and drop the attribute. Everywhere else the codemod removes it.

`Dropdown.Item` is the one to read twice: it accepts `as="a" | "div" | "button"` and takes the
props of whichever you name, so the default `<a>` keeps an `href` and the other two do not.
Drop the `as` to make it a link again; inside the `<button>` form an `<a>` would nest
interactive content, so navigate in `onClick` there.

## `prop:target`, `prop:download`, `prop:hrefLang`, `prop:ping`, `prop:referrerPolicy`, `prop:media`

`target`, `download`, `hrefLang`, `ping`, `referrerPolicy` and `media` follow the element the same way
`href` does, and they are invalid on the wrong one whether or not an `href` is beside them —
`<Navbar.Link as="span" target="_blank">` does not compile on its own. Each is judged against
the element that actually renders, not as a group, so a `referrerPolicy` on an `<img>` or a
`target` on a `<form>` stays where it is legal. Where one is removed the TODO quotes it. Put it
on an `<a>` inside, or make the element one that takes it.

`rel` is never touched: React declares it on `HTMLAttributes`, so it is valid on every element.

A component can be narrower than its element. One that takes no `href` at any `as` takes none of
these either. `Level.Item` is not narrower: it declares the anchor's whole attribute surface at
every `as` and forwards it only on the `<a>`, so all of these survive at `as="a"` and none of
them reaches a `<p>` or a `<div>`.

## `prop:type` — a `<button>` item that no longer submits its form

`Navbar.Item`, `Navbar.Link`, `Menu.Item` and `Dropdown.Item` write `type="button"` on the
`<button>` an `as` makes them render, whenever the element sets no `type` or one HTML doesn't
define. A plain `<button>` with neither submits the form around it, so an item you rendered as a
button with `as="button"` stops submitting once migrated. The codemod can't tell whether one sits
in a form, so each gets a TODO:

```jsx
<Navbar.Item as="button">Search</Navbar.Item>
<Navbar.Item as="button">Search</Navbar.Item>
```

Add `type="submit"` if it should still submit, or `type="button"` to say it shouldn't, then
delete the comment. An item whose `type` is written out as `button`, `submit` or `reset`, or
comes from a spread or an expression, gets no TODO.

## `component:Generic` — rbx's base element

`Generic` is rbx's untyped passthrough. Render the underlying tag, and move its helper props to
the nearest bestax component (or a `className`).

## `component:Dropdown` and its parts

bestax's `Dropdown` takes a `label` and renders its own trigger and menu, so rbx's four-element
structure collapses to one.

```jsx
<Dropdown>
  <Dropdown.Trigger>Open</Dropdown.Trigger>
  <Dropdown.Menu><Dropdown.Content>
    <Dropdown.Item active>one</Dropdown.Item>
  </Dropdown.Content></Dropdown.Menu>
</Dropdown>

<Dropdown label="Open">
  <Dropdown.Item active>one</Dropdown.Item>
</Dropdown>
```

## `Navbar.Item dropdown` — open/close state is not carried over

The structural rewrite is automatic (`<Navbar.Item dropdown>` becomes
`<Navbar.Dropdown>`, and rbx's `<Navbar.Dropdown>` becomes `<Navbar.DropdownMenu>`), but the
**behaviour is not the same**. rbx's dropdown owns its own click and outside-click state; bestax's
`Navbar.Dropdown` is presentational and opens from `hoverable` or a controlled `active`.

So a migrated dropdown renders correctly and does nothing on click. Pick one:

```jsx
<Navbar.Dropdown hoverable>…</Navbar.Dropdown>          // opens on hover
<Navbar.Dropdown active={open}>…</Navbar.Dropdown>      // you own the state
```

Nothing flags this — the markup is valid either way — so audit your navbars after migrating.

## `component:List` — the bulma-list extension

Bulma v1 does not ship it. Use `<UnorderedList>`/`<UnorderedList.Item>` for a plain list, or
`<Menu>`/`<Menu.Item>` when the items are navigation.

## `component:Fieldset`, `component:Numeric`, `component:Highlight`

No bestax equivalents, and none needed: render a plain `<fieldset>` (its `disabled` attribute
works natively), use `Intl.NumberFormat` directly, and use `<Pre>` with your own highlighter.

## `responsive` — `touch` and `{ only: true }`

bestax's viewports are `mobile`/`tablet`/`desktop`/`widescreen`/`fullhd`, with no `touch` and no
`-only` variants. Reach for a `className` with the Bulma class, or restyle in CSS.

The codemod always removes the whole `responsive` prop, even when part of it could not be
converted — bestax has its own unrelated `responsive` prop (`'mobile' | 'narrow'`), so leaving a
half-emptied rbx object behind would be a type error rather than a leftover. The TODO names
which breakpoints did not carry.

## Props with no counterpart

| TODO                                               | What to do                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| `prop:closeOnBlur` on `Modal`                      | the migrated compound form renders `Modal.Background` as you wrote it; wire its `onClick` to your `onClose`                                                                                                                                              |
| `prop:selected`, `prop:text` on `Button`           | `className="is-selected"`; for `is-text` use `color="ghost"` or a link                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `prop:size` on `Button.Group` / `Tags` / `Message` | set `size` on each child instead                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `prop:gradient` on `Hero`                          | Bulma v1 removed `is-bold` gradients; use `bgColor` or a custom class                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `prop:color`, `prop:vertical` on `Divider`         | bestax's `Divider` takes only `bgColor` and renders an `<hr>`                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `component:Divider` (a labelled divider)           | rbx rendered `<Divider>OR</Divider>`'s children as a centred label via `data-content`; bestax's `Divider` is a bare `<hr>` and takes no children -- React rejects children on a void element at runtime. Put the label in surrounding markup, or drop it |
| `prop:direction` on `PageLoader`                   | no directional variant; drop it or add a class                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `prop:managed`                                     | bestax components are uncontrolled; drive the `Modal` with `active` and `onClose`                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `prop:document` on `Modal`                         | bestax portals via `portal`, but it takes `true`, a selector or an element rather than a `Document` — see [Modal: what carries over](#modal-what-carries-over)                                                                                           |
| `prop:document` on `Navbar`                        | bestax's `Navbar` has no `document` prop; drop it                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `badgeOutlined`, `badgeRounded`, `badgeSize`       | bestax's `Badge` has no outline, pill or size variant                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

## Modal: what carries over

`component:Modal` — emitted on **every** Modal the codemod converts, whether or not you passed
any of the props above.

rbx's Modal did three things by default. bestax now does two of them the same way, and the
third is one prop away:

| rbx default                      | bestax                                                             |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| closes on Escape                 | same, `closeOnEscape` defaults to `true`                           |
| clips document scroll while open | same, `lockScroll` defaults to `true`                              |
| portals into `document.body`     | renders inline unless you set `portal` (`true`, selector, element) |

So the only one that needs an edit is the portal, and it matters most when an ancestor has
`overflow: hidden`, `filter` or a `transform` — any of which will clip or re-parent a modal that
used to escape them. `portal` renders inline on the server and during hydration, then moves once
the client takes over, so it is safe under SSR.

The codemod maps `closeOnEsc` to `closeOnEscape` for you, so `closeOnEsc={false}` keeps
suppressing Escape rather than silently inheriting the new default.

Background click depends on which form you land in. bestax's `Modal` has a legacy form — bare
children — where it renders its own background and close button, both wired to `onClose`, so
`closeOnBlur` carries over for free. A `Modal.Content` or `Modal.Card` child selects the compound
form instead, which renders only what you wrote; there, wire your own `Modal.Background`'s
`onClick` to the same `onClose`.

## `value-reference` — a component used as a value

`const X = Card.Header;` and similar. The codemod rewrites what it can prove safe and flags the
rest; convert the usage by hand.

## Dynamic values

Anything the codemod cannot read statically (`state={x}`, `align={side}`,
`subtitle={isSub}`) is left in place with a TODO. Split the branch by hand — the codemod never
guesses at a runtime value.
